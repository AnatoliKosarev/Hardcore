and although it can be argued
whether time will ever come to end
there is an overcoming sense of failing
if you never can see the end
in the giving of our hope eternal
we stumble blindly and forget the way
is there ever time for answers
when the world comes tumbling down
world comes tumbling down
all along we keep staring at the sun
closing our minds
saying we're the ones
all along we keep staring at the sun
blind to see it when the day will come
